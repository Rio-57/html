# HTML Basics

This repository contains a simple HTML file demonstrating basic HTML concepts.

## Content Explained

### 1. Basic Structure
Typing `!` in an HTML file and pressing Enter (in editors like VS Code) generates the basic HTML structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

2. Heading Tag (Commented)
<!-- <h1> this tags are for headings</h1> -->


The <h1> tag is used for headings. This line is commented, so it will not appear on the webpage.

3. Anchor Tag (Commented)
<!-- <a target="_blank" href="link for website">these are anchors tag for link</a> -->


The <a> tag is used to create links. The href attribute contains the website URL, and target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab. This line is commented, so it will not display.

Summary

This file is useful for beginners to understand the basic HTML structure, comments, heading tags, and anchor tags.
